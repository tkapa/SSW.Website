about: '  ,---,Tiago is our favourite creative genius. When he told us he was moving from Australia, we said: _"OK, but you''re still working remotely for us"_. We couldn''t let him go. This was 10+ years before the pandemic, so we are proud to say Tiago is a trailblazer in the realm of remote work. After a few years in Brazil, he now lives and works in the west coast of Canada.  ,With 15+ years experience working as a designer for both print and web projects, he loves spending time designing in Figma or writing clean HTML/CSS for websites and apps... while listening to old songs. Tiago has developed responsive websites and apps ranging from concept, layout, mark-up, implementation, testing, and maintenance.,He is also a Scrum Master and the driving force behind keeping [SSW Rules](https://ssw.com.au/rules) up-to-date. ,Here are some of his skills:,* **User Interface Design** - Websites, apps, and social media assets,* **User Experience** - Research, testing, and prototyping,* **Graphic Design** - Visual identity, and marketing materials,* **Semantic HTML, CSS, Markdown, and JavaScript/JS frameworks** - Accessible, reusable, and clean code'
