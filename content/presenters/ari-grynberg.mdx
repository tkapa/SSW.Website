  ,## Overview,As the CPO it is my intention to be across all property matters
  for all offices â€“ whether that be scheduled maintenance, urgent repairs,
  planned upgrades, and / or designed relocations or expansions.  I would
  envisage visiting and checking in on all our offices periodically over time.
  As is the nature of construction and maintenance, some projects will be small
  easy fast and seamless, and some will be larger more complex, time consuming,
  and annoying to staff. Whichever the path, I will always attempt to be in
  front of the process and demand SSW interests prevail. ,## About me,I am born
  bred and based in Sydney, and will work from the Sydney office. I will get to
  all the SSW offices over time. In my spare time I love to get out into nature,
  and get into the water. I follow all sports (bring back the Bears), a cricket
  tragic, follow current affairs & politics, and Im a father to 3 teenage kids
  and 2 irascible mutts. ,
