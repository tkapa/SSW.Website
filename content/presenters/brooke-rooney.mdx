about: >-
  ,Brooke Rooney is an American from Knoxville, Tennessee, and is incredibly
  excited to be a contributing member of the SSW team. She is the Personal
  Assistant to SSW's Chief Architect, Adam Cogan, and is also responsible for
  the smooth day-to-day running of the office.,Having only been at the office
  for a few months, Brooke is already known for her distinct Southern use of the
  word "y'all", cranking out 6 pull-ups at a time during the company workout
  break, and happily expressing her obsession with anything and everything Lord
  of the Rings. ,She hopes that her positive energy and previous administrative
  experience will encourage more team effectiveness, and help Adam breathe a
  little easier each day.
