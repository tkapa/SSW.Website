about: >-
  ,Joe first discovered the wonders of coding as an impressionable 7 year old
  who stumbled across a BASIC interpreter on his copy of PC-DOS. Later, a
  similar revolution was to occur when he first encountered the world of .NET
  after downloading the first public alpha released to the public back in
  2000.,With strong experience in web-based application development, Joe's had
  experience in a wide variety of situations - from on-the-ground development on
  high-traffic ASP.NET public websites through to developing system
  architectures from the ground up. In recent years he has developed a keen
  interest in user experience and enjoys exploring ways to make software more
  intuitive and enjoyable for users. A strong background in creative arts merged
  with his technical experience has helped contribute to the look and feel of
  sites like [WorleyParsons](https://www.worleyparsons.com/) and [Microsoft
  SharePoint
  Forum](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/sharepoint/).,When he's
  not helping SSW build great software, you're likely to find him working as a
  [music producer and writer](https://joe.hardy.id.au/), seeing live music,
  drinking a latte or enjoying spending time with his wife and daughter.,Joe
  uses Twitter. Why not [follow him](https://twitter.com/flukazoid)?,
