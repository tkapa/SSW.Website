  ,Matt Hodgkins is the hardest working man at SSW. He looks after any and all
  internal server issues while setting up virtual development environments for
  the other developers, and on top of this makes sure we are always running the
  latest version of any technology that comes out that Adam likes the look of. 
  ,Matthew started working at [iiNet](https://www.iinet.net.au/) as soon as he
  finished his HSC, which is where he developed his troubleshooting and support
  skills.  ,He then moved to a small computer company called [Dextralog
  Computers](https://www.dextralog.com.au/) in his home town in Springwood, Blue
  Mountains. His role was to support over 40 small businesses, their servers,
  workstations and applications. During this time he finished his Diploma of
  Network Engineering at Mt Druitt TAFE.  ,Matthew now brings his experience and
  friendly attitude to SSW. His role is to keep all the systems running in top
  notch condition to allow the SSW developers to do what they do best without
  disruptions.
