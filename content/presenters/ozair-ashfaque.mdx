  with migrating a large-scale project from .NET Framework to .NET 8. They
  wanted to avoid a feature freeze and reduce risk by ensuring old parts of the
  app were retired as soon as possible. To accomplish this feat, they utilized a
  reverse proxy (YARP) to run both versions in tandem, allowing for a seamless
  transition and immediate use of new features.
